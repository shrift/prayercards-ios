        <span class="subtitle"><em>&quot;Meeting with God at intervals throughout your day.&quot;</em></span>
        <p>
Set aside a day or two to do all four prayer intervals, just to see how it works. Then begin to build it into your daily routine, starting with the interval that is easiest. Focus on working that interval into your daily routine. Once that interval is in place, add others into your daily pattern. Be patient with yourself and God.

Select a small portion of Scripture (no longer than Psalm 23) and read it over slowly three times, paying attention to a verse, phrase, or image that your heart is drawn to.  Return to that verse, phrase, or image to ponder it more closely. Place yourself in the text as a participant and allow it to speak to you. Listen for the voice as well as the words of the text. Stay with it as long as you like before moving on to another verse, phrase, or image.

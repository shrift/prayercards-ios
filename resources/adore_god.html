To help calm the busy thoughts that might come between you and a simple awareness of God's presence, focus your mind on something concrete and particular that is connected, in some way, to God. It may be a term of endearment for God, or some work of his hands like a scene of natural beaty, or the flame of a candle. As your thoughts begin to wander, which they will, renew your intention to make yourself present to God by gently returning your attention to this focal point.

        <p>
        These cards are intended to be tools (not duties or formulas) to expand your prayer life and experience with God. These are a try-it-out-and-see-what-you-think sort of thing. 
        </p>
        <p>You may want to try the prayer practices in a small group setting. For example, the group might choose one of them to do individually, two or three times throughout the week, then come back the following week to discuss how it went and what they liked and disliked. The next week, they would choose another practice, and so on.

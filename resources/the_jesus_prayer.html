        <span class="subtitle"><em>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.</em><br/>You may shorten it to suit, e.g., <em>&quot;Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.&quot;</em></span>
        <p>
        Connect the prayer to your breathing: &quot;Lord Jesus Christ&quot; [during inhale], &quot;have mercy on me&quot; [during exhale]. Breathe from the abdomen. If connecting the prayer to your breathing is confusing, don&#39;t bother. Try doing the prayer for a specified period, e.g. five or ten minutes. As your thoughts wander, gently return your focus to the words of the prayer.

        <span class="subtitle"><em>Holding loved ones up in love before Love.</em></span>
        <p>
Call to mind those you love, beginning with the people you feel most connected to and have the least conflict with. Simply name each person, one at a time, and hold the loved one in memory for a moment or two before God, who is Love. During this time, don't focus on their faults, or even their pressing needs. Focus on your connection to them and their beloved place before God.       
        </p>

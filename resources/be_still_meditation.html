        <span class="subtitle"><em>&quot;Be still and know that I am God.&quot;</em> Psalm 46:10</span>
        <p>
        Meditate on this verse as though memorizing it, starting with the first word and adding a new word each time: &quot;<em>Be</em>...&quot;, &quot;Be <em>still</em>...&quot; then &quot;Be still <em>and</em>...&quot; then &quot;Be still and <em>know</em>...&quot;, until you have completed the verse. Take your time. Use a full relaxing breath in and out for each segment. Place special emphasis on the newly introduced word (indicated by <em>italics</em>) as you say it aloud or silently.

        <p>
        Jesus of Nazareth, I acknowledge my thirst for what you have to give. I surrender myself to you, whole and entire - what was, and is, and is to come. Plunge the wrongs I have done and the wrongs done to me into your fathomless mercy. Receive me as I am today. Make of me what I am meant to be, and let me walk in the path of your new creation. Amen.
        </p>
